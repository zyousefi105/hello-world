I am using java language for this test. 

I am using two maps, one called goal for recording inputString character frequencies
And another map to record character frequencies of each String in the dictionary if that
Character exists in the goal map. 

Lastly I compare map and goal hashMap to make sure to exclude cases for which frequencies of a character in dictionary strings are more than the inputString.

I included few edge cases to test empty, single character, repeated character, etc.
