1. A Code Editor
* For a code editor, I recommend Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/. I also recommend configuring it to open via the command line:
    * CMD-SHIFT-P 
    * Enter “Shell Command”, and choose “Install ‘code’ command in path. 
    * Then you can run $ code /folder to open folders in VSCode from your shell. 
2. A Command Line Application
* For the command line application, on MacOS or Linux, I recommend the native Terminal application (or Iterm2). 
 
WINDOWS USERS: I absolutely recommend downloading Git Bash. This course was recorded using a bash environment. Using Git Bash will make doing this course a smooth process. Here’s a great stackoverflow thread for configuring Git Bash on on Windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal
 
3. Node.js.
If you don’t already have Node.js installed, here is the download page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once you have Node.js installed, run the following commands on the command line
* $ node -v
    * See a value like `v8.8.1` or higher 
* $ npm -v
    * See a value like `v5.4.2` or higher 
*****
With a Code Editor, Command Line App, and Node.js installed, you should be ready to go!
